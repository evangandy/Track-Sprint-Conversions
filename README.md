Instructions for using the standard table,

To convert a known distance and time to another distance and get an estimated time go across the top row to find your known distance, then go down the rows to find the distance you want to get an estimated time. This will give you the ratio to multiply your known time by to get your estimated time.

## Module 1: Time Converter
- Take inputs: known distance, time, and target distance
- Apply standard conversion formulas (e.g., Riegel formula with exponent 1.06)
- Display predicted time for target distance

## Module 2: Custom Heatmap
- Input times for distances from 36.576m (40yd) to 200m
- Generate conversion ratio matrix between all distances
- Create heatmap visualization of these ratios
- Generate comparison heatmap showing percent difference from standard table

## Module 3: State Cut Times
- Display qualifying times for state competitions
- Add comparison to user's projected times

## Module 4: Mathematical Model
- Develop parametric function starting with 40yd dash time
- Use mathematical modeling (likely exponential or power function)
- Demonstrate how standard tables are derived from basic principles

## Module 5: Implementation
- Web interface with responsive design
- Data visualization using heatmaps and charts
- Save/export functionality for results
